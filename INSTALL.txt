How-to build virtual environment with nodeenv, sample, it seems doesn't work with requirements:

$ nodeenv --requirement=NodeJS/requirements.txt --node=0.6.10 --jobs=4 node-0.6.10

Or, better, it seems not working well on my pc with requirements.txt:

$ nodeenv --node=0.6.10 --jobs=4 node-0.6.10

and then in your svn directory install request module.
Don't commit node_modules directory! :) Put it into svn ignore.

Needed:

http://pythonpackages.com/info/nodeenv

Project actually run on:
* node@0.6.10 (latest stable when writing)
* request@2.9.100
* npm@1.1.1
